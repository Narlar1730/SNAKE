# SNAKE

This is a version of snake that I have made. It is not very good, but I was playing aorund with SFML and wanted to do something quick.

## FEATURES
1. It draws the ?path? I am not sure what the right word is, but it draws the right corners so you can see where your snake has been
2. Allows you to choose restart or quit on loss - done to prove I could create and draw buttons.
3. You can play snake and the apple is a red circle.
4. Its snake. How many features do you need?
